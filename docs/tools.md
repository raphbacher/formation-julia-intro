# Tools

## JuliaPro/JuliaBox
JuliaPro is a distribution of curated packages for Julia (as Anaconda for Python, or Matlab with a set of toolboxes). It is provided freely (but requires a registration to download and install packages) by JuliaComputing.

Juliabox is an online environment (based on Jupyter notebooks) with Julia (and some packages) preinstalled. You can also use it freely (or pay for more computational ressources). It also provides a large number of example notebooks to learn Julia.

## Editors

You can use any editor and the REPL but some tools (IDE) are developed in the community especially to ease data analysis and exploration.

- Julia in VScode
- Juno (Atom)
- Jupyter(lab)

## The REPL

## Jupyter
Julia works very well in Jupyter notebook (in fact the name Jupyter which remplaces the original IPython notebook comes from JU(lia)-PYT(hon)-R once it was realized that most of it concept was language-agnostic)

## Juno
Juno can be seen has

## VSCode
VSCode is very similar to Atom (but developed as an open-source product by Microsoft).

## Speed-up reloads

Revise.jl

## Explore the code

Macros @code_llvm, @code_native, @code_warn

## Learning Ressources
The main Julia documentation is available here :

https://docs.julialang.org/

A lot of ressources are referenced on the Julia website : https://julialang.org/learning/

In particular you can get all the example notebooks (also available in juliabox) here : https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaBoxTutorials

Note :

Julia has been publicly available since 2012 and it has only reached its first stable release 1.0 in August 2018 (all 0.x versions came with breaking changes), so lot of ressources over the web are still not accurate/pertinent for 1.0.
