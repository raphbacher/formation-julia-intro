## Preparation

You are encouraged to come with your personnal computer, *ideally with Julia already installed*.
To install Julia go to
[https://julialang.org/downloads/]() to download and follow instructions there [https://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html#generic-binaries](). For this session we will use the current stable release v1.1.
Once Julia is installed, you can launch the Julia REPL (just type `julia` in Linux/Mac or launch the program "Julia 1.1" from the list of programs under Windows). Then install some useful packages with the following
```julia
julia> import Pkg;Pkg.add(["IJulia","StatsKit","FFTW","Unitful","PlotlyJS","Images","TestImages","Flux","FileIO"])
```


For those who can't bring a laptop, computers with the Ubuntu system will be available.
If you want to explore Julia without installing anything you can also go to [https://juliabox.com](https://juliabox.com) and play with the notebooks available online.
